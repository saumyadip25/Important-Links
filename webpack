Webpack

Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications, including React.js applications. 
It is primarily used to bundle and manage various modules, dependencies, and assets within a web application. 
Webpack takes a modular approach to application development, allowing developers to break their codebase into smaller, more manageable modules and packages.

In the context of React.js, webpack is often used to bundle JavaScript files, JSX files (which contain React components), 
CSS stylesheets, images, and other assets required by the application. It helps in optimising the application's performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests made to the server.

Here are some key features and benefits of using webpack in React.js applications:
* Module Bundling: Webpack allows you to bundle all your JavaScript modules and their dependencies into a single file (or multiple files) called a bundle. 
  This bundling process reduces the number of requests required to load the application, resulting in faster load times.
* Code Splitting: With webpack, you can split your code into multiple chunks and load them asynchronously. 
  This feature is especially useful for large applications, as it allows you to load only the code required for a specific page or feature, improving performance.
* Loaders: Webpack supports various loaders that enable you to preprocess and transform different types of files. For example, 
  you can use loaders to transpile JSX code to plain JavaScript using Babel, apply CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less, or optimise and compress images.
* Development Server: Webpack provides a built-in development server that allows you to run your React.js application locally during development. 
  It supports hot module replacement, which means that changes made to your code are automatically reflected in the browser without requiring a full page reload.
* Production Optimisation: Webpack offers several optimisation techniques, such as minification, code splitting, and tree shaking, which help reduce 
  the size of the bundle and improve the application's performance in production environments.

Overall, webpack is a powerful tool that simplifies the build process and enhances the development experience for React.js applications. 
It streamlines the management of modules, assets, and dependencies, making it easier to create efficient and scalable web applications.


Advantages of bundling into a single file

Allowing the browser to download our entire application once and handle all the other navigations without any additional network calls to our server.
